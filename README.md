- Displays current weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
- Allows users to search for weather by city or geographical coordinates.
- Responsive design, works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios (for API requests), CSS/SCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional, for saving user search history or settings)
